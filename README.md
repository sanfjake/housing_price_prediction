# üè° Housing Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This Python project predicts housing prices based on house size (in square feet) using linear regression. It is designed as a hands-on introduction to data science techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, model training, and user interaction.

 Features

- Loads housing data from a CSV file
- Cleans data by removing invalid or missing entries
- Visualizes the relationship between house size and price
- Trains a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Displays model performance (coefficient, intercept, R¬≤ score)
- Shows the regression line on a scatter plot
- Predicts house prices based on user input
- Handles invalid user input gracefully
- Fully modularized code for maintainability
